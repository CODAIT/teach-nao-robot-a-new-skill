# Teaching your NAO robot a new skill

Here at CODAIT we've started to teach our [NAO robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nao_(robot)) new skills, since his reign as Apache-Spark powered [Rock-Paper-Scissors champion](https://twitter.com/marvinwinsagain) ended. If you own a NAO, you already know he posesses a lot of skills out of the box. 

One easy way to "teach" your Nao new deep learning skills is to connect him to one of our docker-based deep learning model microservices on the [Model Asset eXchange](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/) on IBM Developer.
